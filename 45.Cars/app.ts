// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object.
// The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name.
// It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments.
// Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or
// an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

import { features } from "process";

function storeCarInfo(manufacturer: string, modelName: string, ...extraOption: { [key : string]: any } [] ): object {
    const carInfo = {
        manufacturer,
        modelName,
        ...Object.assign({}, ...extraOption)
    }

    return carInfo;
};

let answer = storeCarInfo('Honda', 'Civic', {color:'Black'}, {features: ['Navigation', 'Power Window']})
console.log(answer);
