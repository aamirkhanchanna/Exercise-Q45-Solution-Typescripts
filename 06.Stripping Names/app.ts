// Stripping Names: Store a person’s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name.
// Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once.
// Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed.
// Then print the name after striping the white spaces.
